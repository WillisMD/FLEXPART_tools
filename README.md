# FLEXPART_tools
Python scripts for calculating potential emission sensitivities (PES) from FLEXPART-WRF and FLEXPART-ECMWF output generated along [NETCARE](https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/special_issue835.html) 2014 and 2015 flight tracks.

Additional scripts for plotting polar stereographic projections of the two dimensional PES, and folding the PES with other geospatial data (e.g., sea ice concentrations).

Tested with Python 3.5
